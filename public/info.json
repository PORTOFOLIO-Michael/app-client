      "summary": "Hi, I'm Michael, a 29-year-old computer science graduate with a passion for front-end development and a touch of back-end experience. I love styling websites and components, believing that front-end development is where creativity and open-mindedness truly shine. It's fascinating how something that looks great in design tools like Figma or Zeplin can differ once it's on a user's display, and I enjoy navigating these challenges to create beautiful, functional interfaces. In my free time, I love watching movies, playing PC games, meeting friends, and reading books. Now that I've completed my degree, I have more time to indulge in these hobbies. While I have a strong passion for front-end development, I'm open-minded and interested in exploring various job opportunities. opportunities where I can express myself and contribute to innovative projects.",
